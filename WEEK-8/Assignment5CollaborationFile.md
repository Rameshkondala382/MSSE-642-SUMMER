. The course focuses on developing secure software through a combination of theoretical knowledge and hands-on practice with industry-standard tools and environments, including Kali Linux, Metasploit, Vagrant, and Git.

Each week's work is organized in its respective directory, documenting a progression from foundational security concepts to advanced penetration testing and secure development practices. Assignments include:

Weekly reflections on course content and learning experiences
Detailed security risk analyses covering critical security topics such as injection vulnerabilities, cryptographic failures, broken access control, and security logging
Practical labs and exercises, including penetration testing, threat modeling, and secure CI/CD pipeline management
Real-world scenarios simulating both attacker and defender perspectives
The course emphasizes a security-first mindset, encouraging students to think like both attackers and defenders to better understand and mitigate risks. Collaboration, code reviews, and best practices in secure software development are also highlighted throughout the course.
