Step 1: Created a New Feature Branch

I created a feature branch using Visual Studio Code by clicking the branch icon in the bottom left and selecting + Create new branch.
I named the branch: feat/assignment4 before adding new branch

after adding used the CLI, to see the local and remote branches.

Committed  changes to the local repo branch and then publish to the remote repo.

What is different when you run git branch and git branch -r?

| Command         | Lists                    | Scope        |
| --------------- | ------------------------ | ------------ |
| `git branch`    | Local branches           | Local only   |
| `git branch -r` | Remote-tracking branches | Remote only  |
| `git branch -a` | Both local and remote    | All branches |
