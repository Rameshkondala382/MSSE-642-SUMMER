**Step 1: Created a New Feature Branch
**

I created a feature branch using Visual Studio Code by clicking the branch icon in the bottom left and selecting + Create new branch.
I named the branch: feat/assignment4 before adding new branch

**What is different when you run git branch and git branch -r?
**


| Command         | Lists                    | Scope        |
| --------------- | ------------------------ | ------------ |
| `git branch`    | Local branches           | Local only   |
| `git branch -r` | Remote-tracking branches | Remote only  |
| `git branch -a` | Both local and remote    | All branches |


** issued a pull request to merge  feature branch on the remote repo
**
